Cattle identification is extremely important in farming due to its use in showing ownership and herd management for reproduction, 
raising and caring for livestock, also for health purposes and breeding decisions. 
Theft, faulty breeding, mismanagement of livestock, and reproduction problems, 
resulting in loss of profits is only a few complications that are due to insufficient methods for real-time classification of cattle 
for farmer both domestic and commercial in Africa.
Especially in rural areas. Traditional methods for cattle identification such as tattooing, ear tagging,
branding and micro-chip implantation which have been in use for years have their own limitations. 
They offer limited security and are invasive.  
These Non-biometric methods since they can disintegrate overtime and can easily be removed or damaged have boundaries.
Therefore, there is a need in the market for a non-invasive and cost-effective and biometric approach to better tackle the problem and
resolve these issues. 
Namely based on Computer Vision technology.  
Existing livestock/cattle identification recognition systems are non-mobile, 
they fail to function in real-time environment, processing time is unreasonable (taking 5-7minutes to classify),
and provide insufficient accuracy. 

This work attempts to resolve the cattle identification problem using the most robust and fast image recognition techniques based on machine learning. Preliminary results show that it is possible to tackle the time challenge offered by tradition recognition systems. It is also possible for farmer whom are less familiar with the livestock to use a mobile device that has a camera with a reasonable resolution (3-8mega pixels) to classify each cattle with an accuracy of 90% for better management. All the particular cowâ€™s information is available to the farmer on hand. This technology is crucial to small farmers and to commercial farmers, it makes easier for them to better adapt to new farming techniques.
This study will produce a machine learning based cattle recognition system. After the development of the system a user interface will be developed for farmers so that farmers are able to use the system in real-time. The table 1 below shows all the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional cattle identification methods.

Tools: Django, Python(TensorFlow and other libraries see link below), SQLite, HTML & CSS Bootstrap, javascript.
